This was a Java course lab assignment from school, completed with the help of some AI compilers. It's been continuously updated and revised according to the assignment requirements. I plan to rewrite it myself once I'm more familiar with Java.

In fact, I have basically included all the homework content, and the subsequent optimization may be to depict the UI interface in more detail, and also to add database functions, but I have not learned yet, and there are other functional expansions that may also be added
